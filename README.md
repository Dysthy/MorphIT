**ModelShifter** allows you to change the appearance of players completely client-side, while using the power of mods to add way more cool details than a simple resource pack ever could!

# Features
- **Works like a resource pack**: ModelShifter allows you to change player models completely client-side, so that only you will be able to see them, even if other players look different
- **Choose from a wide range of models**: The mod includes plenty of custom-made models for your player, with a lot more still to come in future updates
- **Model Selection GUI**: Change or disable your custom player model through ModelShifter's unique GUI, which can be accessed through the new purple button in the optios menu

# Installation
ModelShifter is compatible with **Fabric**, on versions 1.20.6 up to 1.21.1 and can be installed through the Modrinth app, as well as through other launchers with Modrinth support.

The mod requires [**GeckoLib**](https://modrinth.com/mod/geckolib) to work, which will automatically be added to your mods if you install ModelShifter through the modrinth app.
