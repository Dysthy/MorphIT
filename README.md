**ModelShifter** allows you to change the appearance of players completely client-side, while using the power of mods to add way more cool details than a simple resource pack ever could! Change yourself and others into **cats**, **ghasts** and many more pre-defined models.

Ever wanted to play a minigame with everyone being a cat? Well, now it's possible!

# Features
- **Works like a resource pack**: ModelShifter allows you to change player models completely client-side, so that only you will be able to see them, even if other players look different
- **Choose from a wide range of models**: The mod includes plenty of custom-made models for your player, with a lot more still to come in future updates (take a look at the [Gallery](https://modrinth.com/mod/model-shifter/gallery) for some examples)
- **Model Selection GUI**: Change or disable your custom player model through ModelShifter's unique GUI, which can be accessed through the new purple button in the optios menu
- **Works on every Server**: Since ModelShifter runs completely client-side and only introduces cosmetic changes, it can be used on every server without creating any issues with anticheats or similar problems!
