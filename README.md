## MorphIT

**MorphIT** **(based on ModelShifter)** lets you change player appearances with custom models, fully client-side but synchronized via a Paper plugin. Transform yourself and others into any custom model from a resource pack.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- **Server-Synchronized Models**: MorphIT communicates with a compatible **Paper plugin** using plugin messaging, ensuring transformations are synced in multiplayer.
- **Resource Pack Integration**: Models can be added via your resource pack or directly inside the project.
- **No Pre-Bundled Models**: MorphIT ships with no default models ‚Äî you add your own.
- **Command-Only Control**: Unlike ModelShifter‚Äôs GUI, MorphIT is controlled entirely through server commands.
- **Version Support**: Currently only supports **Minecraft 1.21.1**.

## üì¶ Models
Since MorphIT comes without pre-bundled models, you‚Äôll need to provide your own via a resource pack or custom assets.

## üöÄ Installation
1. Install MorphIT (Fabric / 1.21.1).
2. Install the required **Paper plugin** for communication.
3. Add your models via resource packs or directly into the mod.
4. Ensure [**GeckoLib**](https://modrinth.com/mod/geckolib) is also installed.
